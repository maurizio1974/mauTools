N O T E:
    Convert soft selection into skin weights. More influences can be added by
    clicking the plus button. When more influences are added these weights are
    automatically blended. The influence and soft selection can be reselected
    by right clicking the influence widget and using the context menu. 
    
    Skin cluster settings like max influences and normalization will be taken
    into account when applying the skin weights.
