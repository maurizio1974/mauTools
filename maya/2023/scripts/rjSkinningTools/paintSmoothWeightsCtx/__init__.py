I N S T A L L A T I O N:
    Copy the "rjSkinningTools" folder to your Maya scripts directory:
        C:\\Users\<USER>\Documents\maya\scripts
        
U S A G E:
    Select a skinned object and run the following code:
        from rjSkinningTools import paintSmoothWeightsCtx;
        paintSmoothWeightsCtx.paint()
    
N O T E:
    The paint tool calls a script that find the surrounding vertices and its 
    skin weights. These skin weights are then blended with the skin weights 
    of the original vertex based value of the paint tool.
        * Undo-able / Redo-able

    Based on the settings on the skinCluster the following attribute will be 
    respected while smoothing the weights:
        * Max Influences
        * Normalize Weights
        * Locked Influences

    I would like to note that the idea for this script came from 
    `Tom Ferstl <https://vimeo.com/tomferstl>` he developed a script where 
    the end results is very simular. I did use the original script as an 
    inspiration, but what happens under the hood is completely different.
