N O T E:
    Tweak vertex weights with sliders or spinbox input fields. This tool will
    give the user a good overview of what influences are translating the 
    vertex. At the same time being able to tweak those influence to a 0.001 
    of precision, while setting the locked state of certain influences. It 
    also shows if the maximum amount of influences is exceeded. The ui gets 
    updated every time the selection is changed in Maya.
