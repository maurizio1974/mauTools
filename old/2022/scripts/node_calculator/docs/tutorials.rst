Tutorials
==============================================================================

The following videos should give you a good overview how to use the NodeCalculator.

.. note::
    If you're unsure whether this tool is interesting for you: Watch an :ref:`example video<soft-approach-value-example>` first. You might not understand the details, but you'll see what the NodeCalculator allows you to do.

    I recommend to watch the videos in order. They go into more and more
    detail, so if you feel you know enough to work with the NodeCalculator: Feel free to stop. When you need to understand the tool better, you can come back for the remaining, more in-depth videos.
