The NodeCalculator is an OpenSource Python module that allows you to *create node networks in Autodesk Maya by writing math formulas*.

The idea for this tool originated from the incredibly tedious process of translating a math formula into Maya nodes. Often times the mathematical logic is simple and could be written down in a few seconds. But then you find yourself spending the next 30 minutes translating that formula into Maya commands.
The NodeCalculator tries to speed up and ease that process.

**I hope this tool brings the fun & beauty of math back to the Maya TDs out there ;)**
