These pages are auto-created from the docStrings of the NodeCalculator files.

.. note::
    **For completeness ALL functions & methods are listed in this documentation.** When using the NodeCalculator in Maya you should only use the *public* functions & methods!

    You won't have to deal with functions & methods in Maya that are...

    * *protected*. They start with one underscore: *_some_protected_function()*.
    * *private*. They start and end with two underscores: *__some_private_function__()*.
