New collections can be added in the COLLECTIONS variable. Since this
COLLECTIONS variable is an OrderedDict, it will keep the order. A
collection can be defined by who will be using it. Currently it is
divided by different specialties. Each specialty contains a list of
categories that will be displayed. The category names link to the categories
defined in the quality assurance checks themselves.
